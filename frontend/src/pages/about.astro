        FutureSignals transforms raw prediction market data into actionable editorial narratives,
        helping you understand what markets are actually pricing in.
      </p>

      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <p>
        We monitor prediction markets 24/7, detecting significant probability shifts before they
        become news. When we spot a signal — a market moving 7% or more with substantial volume —
        we generate an editorial analysis explaining what changed, why it matters, and what to watch next.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Prediction Markets?</h2>
      <p>
        Prediction markets aggregate the collective intelligence of thousands of participants who
        put real money behind their beliefs. Research shows they consistently outperform polls,
        pundits, and traditional forecasting methods. They're not perfect, but they're often the
        best real-time signal we have about future events.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Signal Detection</h2>
      <p>
        Not every market move is newsworthy. We focus on signals that meet specific criteria:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Significant movement:</strong> At least 7% probability change</li>
        <li><strong>Real volume:</strong> Minimum $50,000 in 24-hour trading</li>
        <li><strong>Market relevance:</strong> Active markets with established liquidity</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Categories</h2>
      <p>We cover four main areas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Politics:</strong> Elections, policy decisions, central bank actions</li>
        <li><strong>Tech:</strong> AI developments, regulation, major company events</li>
        <li><strong>Crypto:</strong> ETF approvals, protocol updates, market milestones</li>
        <li><strong>Global:</strong> Geopolitical events, international affairs, conflicts</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Editorial Independence</h2>
      <p>
        FutureSignals provides editorial analysis only. We don't offer financial advice,
        we don't tell you what to trade, and we don't have positions in the markets we cover.
        Our goal is to make prediction market data accessible and understandable.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Sources</h2>
      <p>
        Our primary data source is <a href="https://polymarket.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polymarket</a>,
        the leading prediction market platform. We access data through their public APIs and
        process it in real-time to detect signals.
