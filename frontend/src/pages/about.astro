        The Bloomberg of Prediction Markets. We transform raw prediction market data into
        actionable editorial content, helping you understand what markets are pricing in.
      </p>

      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <p>
        FutureSignals monitors <a href="https://polymarket.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polymarket</a> 24/7,
        automatically detecting new markets, significant probability shifts, and generating editorial analysis.
        When something moves, we explain what changed, why it matters, and what to watch next.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Prediction Markets?</h2>
      <p>
        Prediction markets aggregate the collective intelligence of thousands of participants who
        put real money behind their beliefs. Research shows they consistently outperform polls,
        pundits, and traditional forecasting methods. They're not perfect, but they're often the
        best real-time signal we have about future events.
